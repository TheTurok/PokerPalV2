    // also if you can possible keep the array of all nine players in here, it would be great
    //if there's a better place let me know

/*main three files to complete*/
    //Players - plyer Object
    //Actions - the things playrs can do when buttons are presssed (should extned Game Logic)
    //GameLogic - the turn base logic, and this would do all-in-logic, big blind small blind, etc.
                //game should take care of small blind big blind
                //we should extend many files for this Game Logic to make things look simpler
/*etc files to do*/
    //wifi
    //lobby
    //undo

    //General Tree = would be Game -> choose next player info -> player can do an -> action

    //Note player doesn't call action class, we just keep the functions in that class for simplicity

    //Please keep everything simple, long good names are fine, i rather not have to deal with "m_" work etiquette ahah
