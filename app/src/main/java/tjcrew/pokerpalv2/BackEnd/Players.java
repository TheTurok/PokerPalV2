    //You will implement the class of players
    //make sure it has all the information
    // also if you can possible keep the array of all nine players in here, it would be great
    //if there's a better place let me know



    //I will also like you to make another class which handles all the buttons pressed by pokertable activity.
    //To keep it simple, i want activity classes seperate from the actual class that deals with math and turns.


    //Players - plyer Object
    //Action - the things pleyrs can do when buttons are presssed
    //Game - the turn base it goes through, and this would do all-in-logic, big blind small blind, etc.

    //General would be Game -> choose next player info -> player can do an -> action

    //Note player doesnt call action class, jwe jsut keep the functions in that class for simplicity
